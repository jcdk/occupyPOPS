# occupyPOPS
a twitter bot concerned with privately-owned public spaces in new york city

This twitter bot has not been updated in sometime, but it is still running! I very much welcome collaboration on keeping this project alive. 

A few changes that might contribute to the aims of the project include:
* PDO queries and generally refactor all code
* pull quotations from a csv or json instead of databse so that others may be able to contribute quotes about public space to the repository
* Google streetview images of POPS to share with tweets
* the foursquare integration might not be of any use anymore
